# dataloadgen

Godoc: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vikstrous/dataloadgen

This is a fork of github.com/vikstrous/dataloadgen that uses generics
instead of code genation. See the docs there for the motivation and usage details.

With this package you can skip the generation step! That's why it's dataload`gen` (gen stands for generics).

To add this package as a dependency:

```
go get github.com/mshaeon/dataloadgen
```

This package has evolved to include some ideas from dataloader https://github.com/graph-gophers/dataloader

Benchmarks show that this package is faster than both of the above and offers the best of both worlds.
